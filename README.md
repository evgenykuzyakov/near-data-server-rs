# FASTNEAR API

The low-latency API for wallets and explorers.

## Overview

There are 4 APIs provided to replace deprecated `api.kitwallet.app` endpoint:

1. Public Key to Account ID mapping.
   - Full Access Public Key to Account ID mapping.
   - Any Public Key to Account ID mapping.
2. Account ID to delegated staking pools (validators).
3. Account ID to fungible tokens (FT contracts).
4. Account ID to non-fungible tokens (NFT contracts).

#### Full Access Public Key to Account ID mapping.
